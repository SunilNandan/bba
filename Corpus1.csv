1,Trifacta,"At Trifacta, we know that the key to winning with Big Data lies with people. That’s why our innovations focus on the user experience—to provide radical productivity gains for data professionals, and enable business analysts to work directly with Big Data. The result: faster, better decisions across the organization.  
Our technical vision focuses on connecting human intuition with computational power. Analysts get clear visibility and light touchpoints on massive data; algorithms extract signals and patterns from data and user behavior; interfaces surface machine suggestions and visualizations for further human attention.
For the user, the experience is simply an intuitive, agile new way of working with data.
  Success in the 21st century depends on leveraging the data at your disposal. Yet for many organizations, data still seems too complex, varied and vast to be useful on a daily basis. Trifacta’s mission is to change all that, and enable you to quickly transform Big Data from a burden into a strategic asset."

4,Visier,"The idea of Visier was conceived one springtime night when John Schwarz, former CEO of Business Objects and SAP Executive Board Member, met Ryan Wong, his former Chief Technical Architect, who was then head of Engineering worldwide at SAP, for dinner. John and Ryan reflected on their shared experiences and decided that, if they could start over, they could address key pain points that their business intelligence customers had: that the cost was too high, the deployment time too long, the skills required on behalf of the end user too unreasonable. And they could do this by developing an innovative Applied Big Data solution that puts answers to important questions at the fingertips of all decision makers

8,Alpine data labs,"It's no secret: the Big Data Era is upon us. There isn't a single day when new statistics are published about the growth of the data generated, collected and available for us to mine and analyze.

If you've come to our site, you most likely want to take advantage of the amazing opportunity Big Data represents. Problem is, the road to Big Data ROI has been fraught with peril and compromise. Despite the billions of dollars companies have invested in Big Data, only a small minority have been able to drive business value from it. That's appalling: at Alpine Data Labs, we've made it our mission to end this compromise.

We have built the World's Most Comprehensive Advanced Analytics Platform for Big Data. Our goal is to help your company drive business value from your Big Data investment faster. Here is what we believe and separates us from the pack.

ADVANCED ANALYTICS IN THE BIG DATA ERA. When Gartner Research selected Alpine Data Labs as one of a small number of companies for its Magic Quadrant, the research firm highlighted some of our key differentiators: scalability, our modern collaborative approach and taking customer input to help drive the product roadmap. Gartner also noted that the world has changed quite a bit since the first predictive analytics companies entered this market. We agree: thirty years ago, it was acceptable to extract data before analyzing it. Thirty years ago, it was acceptable to rely on samples to assert your assumptions. Thirty years ago, it was acceptable to only work small datasets. Thirty years ago, it was acceptable to work in isolation from the rest of the company. If your team is forced to work today with the same tools and approach the industry used thirty years ago, they will miss the Big Data opportunity. In a post-internet and post-Hadoop world, why would your people have to download software? Why would they have to learn multiple programming languages? Why would they have to work with limited datasets? Why limit yourself to a desktop solution that not only fails to scale but exposes your organization to risk, because data and results are stored on laptops and shared by email?

Alpine Chorus 5.0 is the world's only advanced analytics platform that is 100% visual, web-based, collaborative and optimized for Big Data.

OPTIMIZED FOR ALL DATA: HADOOP, DATABASE AND ALL COMMONLY USED DATA SOURCES. If you've been part of a data analysis team, then you know that the process of data wrangling is a very painful one. First, teams have to be able to discover what data is available for them to analyze. Next, once you have found the data, it must be moved to a dedicated analytical environment before analysts and data scientists can start their work. Third, your data needs to be massaged, transformed, and structured for usable advanced analysis. If, by chance, miscommunications occur - and they alwyas do - data has to be moved back-and-forth multiple times. The inefficiences of such methods compound into a data pipeline process that can cost the average organization months and millions of dollars. Unsurprisingly, research found that more than 86% of the data a company stores goes unused! At Alpine Data Labs, we are committed to helping you analyze as much data as you want without the need for additional software, hardware or complex configuration.

COMMITTED TO ANALYTICS EXCELLENCE. Analytics Excellence is achieved when your processes and practices can be applied repeatedly and in a predictable manner. That's why we've worked hard to deliver operational functionality embedded in your analytical workflow. With Alpine Chorus, your team is able to:

Work with the latest innovations with ease. We embrace industry standards like PMML, as well as open source platform technologies (Spark, MADlib, MLLib, and others). Alpine Chorus is one of the first Advanced Analytics platform to be certified on Spark and Cloudera CDH5.

Extend your analysis to production. With the Alpine Chorus REST API, it is now possible to edit, run, and integrate predictive models as part of your end-to-end analytic workflow.

Manage the analytics full-life cycle. Version control at every step of data with complete history, roll-back, commenting, model review and tracking.

BROWSE DATABASE AND HADOOP FILE SYSTEM DATA. With Alpine Chorus, analysts can browse and explore datasets across the enterprise. Once a data set is associated with a workspace, Alpine Chorus will manage the flow of data, track dependencies, and always have the most recent version due to its in-cluster technology. Analysts can operate on the data and share the results of their analysis as a new dataset, which can then be discovered and accessed by other users.

SELF-SERVICE PROVISIONING. With Alpine Chorus, the data science team can create new sandboxes with a few simple clicks. There is no longer a need to file a ticket with IT and wait days (or weeks) for the solution. With self- service provisioning, users can instantiate new sandbox schemas on the fly within existing infrastructure.

MINE, MODEL, AND LEVERAGE YOUR DATA WHERE IT LIVES. With Alpine Chorus, business analysts and data scientists perform every aspect of the analytics workflow —exploration and profiling, transformation, modeling, and scoring— without needing to extract or move data to a separate analytics environment. Because Alpine leverages the scalability of existing database and Hadoop platforms, these processes can be performed with no limitations on the size or complexity of your data"

13,Splunk,"Passionate
“People + Product + Passion = Splunk”
You can have the best people and the best product in the world, but without passion, you can't call it Splunk. Passion is the single most valuable element of our culture. It's the one emotion which all Splunkers possess the most of, the quality that drives us further and enables us to reach higher. It's the reason we get excited to share Splunk with anyone who will listen and it's the reason we keep striving every day to protect what Splunk is and improve what Splunk does. And if you don't believe it, just ask us to tell you about Splunk and see what happens.
Disruptive
“We strive to lead, not follow, while continuing to disrupt the market.”
We have never settled for the status quo. We look at a problem and ask, “How can we do that better?” We recognize when we (or others) fail to execute, learn from those lessons—and submit a new, better solution to the problem. We continually reevaluate the solution to ensure it is still the best answer and tweak it to take advantage of new pieces of information.
Open
“We are open and honest in our interactions.”
We keep it real by being open and honest. We are a collaborative team that understands the value in open communication—it's how we interact with our customers. We have an open door policy—and we like it that way. At Splunk, our customers are number one and that's how they are treated.
Fun
“We are committed to this environment of having fun and working hard at the same time.”
“Work hard, play harder” has been a phrase used at Splunk since the time when we all sat in the same office and had to build our own desks. We are a company that recognizes that we are only as good as those around us. People who do not look forward to representing Splunk every day are not the type of people that will catapult us to the upper echelons of success. We are committed to having every employee WANT to give it their all, be respectful and a part of this family, and have a smile on their face while doing it"

A company based on Values
Enterprises built to endure stand on a foundation of core values. In 2003, we undertook the first disciplined reexamination of our Values in nearly 100 years.
Through ValuesJam – an unprecedented 72-hour discussion on the global intranet – IBMers came together to define the essence of the company. The result? A set of core Values – defined by IBMers for IBMers – that shape everything we do and every choice we make on behalf of the company.
This shared set of Values helps guide our decisions, actions and behaviors and is at the core of our collective aspiration to be recognized as a great company.
“If there's no way to optimize IBM through organizational structure or by management dictate, you have to empower people while ensuring that they're making the right calls the right way. And by 'right,' I'm not talking about ethics and legal compliance alone; those are table stakes. I'm talking about decisions that support and give life to IBM's strategy and brand, decisions that shape a culture. That's why values, for us, aren't soft. They're the basis of what we do, our mission as a company...You've got to create a management system that empowers people and provides a basis for decision making that is consistent with who we are at IBM.”

With ingenuity, innovation and a healthy measure of inspiration, Syncsort is committed to helping the world’s data-intensive organizations unleash the power of Big Data Integration to collect, process and distribute Big Data.  We strive to help our customers ask the Big questions by making what was hard easy and what was impossible routine.
 
The secret to our success has been to continually innovate and evolve our software as new, disruptive technologies and approaches are employed by IT organizations to enable the business to compete and grow.  Here’s a brief recap of our story, from our founding legacy as the world’s most popular and widely used mainframe sorting software to today’s data integration solutions that provide a smarter way to maximize the value of Big Data.
Rethinking the economics of data since 1968

In the early days of mainframe computing, systems required huge monetary investments, specialized expertise to operate and a large amount of time to perform even the simplest functions. In 1968, seven recent graduates of New York University and Columbia University forged a partnership to find a better, smarter way to process data. They were determined to develop a software solution that increased mainframe performance while reducing operational costs.
 
Starting business as Whitlow Computer Systems, the seven partners spent years perfecting a series of algorithms that streamlined mainframe sorting, used less resources, adapted to specific environmental variables and scaled to meet the demands of growing data volumes. In time, the team at Whitlow developed software that vastly outperformed all other sorting solutions and earned their first patents. In late 1971, these patented algorithms became the basis of the first version of their solution. They called it “SyncSort.”
Integrating Big Data…Smarter for today’s most successful organizations.

Today, Syncsort is expanding our Big Data Integration solutions to provide data-intensive organizations across the big data continuum with a smarter way to collect and process the ever-expanding data avalanche.  With thousands of deployments across all major platforms, including mainframe, Syncsort helps customers around the world to overcome the architectural limits of today’s ETL and Hadoop environments, empowering their organizations to drive better business outcomes in less time, with less resources and lower TCO.

Headquartered in New Jersey, Syncsort has international subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, with support centers across the United States and the Netherlands. "

Whatever their role, each Aerospiker combines an uncompromising engineering mindset with an unwavering focus on executing in service of the mission on behalf of our community.
We’re here for the long haul
Continually improving Aerospike takes time, energy, hardware, and the hard work of many people. Our business model - with full speed and scale open source funded by our Enterprise NoSQL Edition - allows us to continue to innovate in systems and data structures, to provide high grade support, and be here to help when you need it.

AN ENGINEERING CULTURE
Engineers build things that solve problems, speak up when things aren’t right, evaluate ideas on their merits and build things that fix what’s broken. At Aerospike, we are all engineers and we are focused on solving the hardest problems we can find.

MARKETING YOUR SUCCESS
We’ve succeeded only when you’re using Aerospike to build something cool. Anything else is an opinion --- engineering includes the tradeoffs. Engineering proves its worth when it solves real world problems, not academic exercises.

enterprise NoSQL innovations
THE BEST IDEA WINS
We don’t get everything correct. We’ve got our opinions, our plans, and we trade complexity for features and performance daily. Our internal processes can be contentious, our forum conversations can be heated, but every conversation has one goal: a better enterprise NoSQL database solution

INNOVATION IN BUSINESS
Aerospike prices Enterprise Edition by data volume. We saw that database pricing based on nodes was irrational - that business value was based on the quantity and velocity of data. By pricing closest to business value - not node count - we make sure your operations staff chooses the right hardware, instead playing games to avoid software licenses."

24,Confluent,"Founded by the team that built Apache Kafka™, Confluent builds a stream data platform

Every byte of data has a story to tell, something of significance that will inform the next thing to be done. In a data-driven enterprise, how we move our data becomes nearly as important as the data itself. With greater speed and agility, data’s value increases exponentially.

From its very early days, we have open-sourced Kafka and have led it to impressive industry-wide adoption across several thousand companies. Now we are focusing on building a stream data platform to help other companies get easy access to enterprise data as real-time streams."

Our values

Challenge

Qlik is a place for creating impact—not for protecting the status quo. We challenge assumptions and respectfully guide others at all levels of our organization to consider new ideas and alternative paths. Every day, we strive to keep our customer promise: be easy to work with, deliver rapid time to success and provide innovative solutions.


Move fast

Qlik helps people to discover fast insights and make effective decisions. It’s a dynamic world operating at a rapid pace, but we know momentum is more powerful than motion, and leadership is more valuable than speed. Great ideas need wings and landing gear to be successful. At Qlik, we pause with purpose to consider when to act with urgency—and when to take more time to gain the clarity that acting with vision and purpose requires.


Be open and straightforward

We know openly sharing appropriate information builds clarity and benefits everyone. So, at Qlik, we first seek to understand. In an effort to foster continuous learning, we listen receptively to feedback when it’s given and actively seek it when it’s not. We have the confidence to provide input, ideas and advice to others regardless of their role. Straightforward communication means speaking respectfully—with no agenda other than creating clarity and understanding.


Take responsibility

At Qlik, we take responsibility seriously and interpret it broadly. We are committed to addressing customer needs and concerns. We hold ourselves accountable for what we do—and don’t do. We reach back to help someone else move forward and mentor others as part of our learning culture. As citizens of the world, we take responsibility for more than ourselves. We donate our personal and professional time to Change Our World, the Qlik corporate social responsibility initiative. Together, we’re striving to touch one billion lives for the better.


Teamwork for results

Our aspirations are too great to act alone. We are results-driven people, building a culture of inclusion. We are humble enough to rely on others and trustworthy enough to deliver when others count on us. We value expertise beyond our own and proactively seek ideas, support and advice from our colleagues. We treat others as we want to be treated and offer assistance when needed."
